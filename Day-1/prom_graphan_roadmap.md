# ðŸ“Š Roadmap for Prometheus & Grafana

This roadmap will guide you step by step in learning and implementing **Prometheus** (monitoring & alerting) and **Grafana** (visualization & dashboards).

---

## 1. Fundamentals of Monitoring
- Understand **why monitoring is important** in modern systems.
- Key concepts:
  - Metrics (time-series data)
  - Logs vs Metrics vs Traces
  - Observability pillars
- SLO, SLI, SLA basics.

---

## 2. Prometheus Basics
- Introduction to **Prometheus**:
  - Pull-based metrics collection
  - Time-series database
- Core components:
  - **Prometheus Server**
  - **Exporters** (e.g., Node Exporter, cAdvisor)
  - **Alertmanager**
- PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) basics:
  - Instant vectors
  - Range vectors
  - Functions & operators

---

## 3. Hands-On with Prometheus
- Install & run Prometheus (Docker or binary).
- Configure `prometheus.yml`.
- Scrape metrics from:
  - Node Exporter
  - Application (custom metrics)
- Explore `/metrics` endpoints.

---

## 4. Grafana Basics
- Introduction to **Grafana**:
  - Data sources
  - Dashboards
  - Panels
- Connect Grafana with Prometheus as a data source.
- Create basic dashboards.

---

## 5. Advanced Prometheus
- Deep dive into **PromQL** queries:
  - Rate, Increase, Histogram functions
  - Aggregations
- Recording rules & alerting rules.
- Setup **Alertmanager** for notifications (Slack, Email, PagerDuty).

---

## 6. Advanced Grafana
- Variables & templating.
- Importing community dashboards.
- Alerting in Grafana (Alerting vs Prometheus Alertmanager).
- Role-based access control (RBAC).

---

## 7. Integration & Ecosystem
- Use **Pushgateway** for short-lived jobs.
- Integrate with Kubernetes:
  - kube-state-metrics
  - Prometheus Operator
- Service discovery in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure).

---

## 8. Best Practices
- Metric naming conventions.
- Label cardinality management.
- Retention policies & storage scaling.
- High availability setup (Thanos, Cortex, Mimir).

---

## 9. Real-World Use Cases
- Infrastructure monitoring (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network).
- Kubernetes cluster monitoring.
- Application performance monitoring (APM).
- Business metrics dashboards.

---

## 10. Next Steps
- Learn **OpenTelemetry** for metrics, logs, and traces.
- Explore **Loki** (logs) and **Tempo** (traces) with Grafana stack.
- Automate deployment using **Helm charts** or **Terraform**.
